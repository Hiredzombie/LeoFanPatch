README

Version 1.0

Purpose: 

	- Allows you to Read Leo Saturday A or B first as normal, and then when choosing the opposite choice, skip previously viewed dialouge while still being able to see the changes between A and B. Fixes small typos and adds logic to diner choices.

Install:

	- Drop the folder 'game' into your Echo Install location (where the .exe is) and allow it to overwrite files if prompted.

Changelong:
    - Complexity of certain sentences are different from A and B. Chose to keep B's more complex sentence structure for both.
            A Lines Changed: 70, 99-100, 118-124, 313
    - Added in missing dead phone line from B into A, Line 699
    - Took B's script for the Menu Split on Choice as it's less messey/more complex compared to A
